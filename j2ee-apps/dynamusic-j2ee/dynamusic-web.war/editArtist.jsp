                                    What is a saint? A saint is someone who has achieved a remote human possibility. It
                                    is impossible to say what that possibility is. I think it has something to do with
                                    the energy of love. Contact with this energy results in the exercise of a kind of
                                    balance in the chaos of existence. A saint does not dissolve the chaos; if he did
                                    the world would have changed long ago. I do not think that a saint dissolves the
                                    chaos even for himself, for there is something arrogant and warlike in the notion of
                                    a man setting the universe in order. It is a kind of balance that is his glory. He
                                    rides the drifts like an escaped ski. His course is the caress of the hill. His
                                    track is a drawing of the snow in a moment of its particular arrangement with wind
                                    and rock. Something in him so loves the world that he gives himself to the laws of
                                    gravity and chance.
                                    Far from flying with the angels, he traces with the fidelity of a seismograph needle
                                    the state of the solid bloody landscape. His house is dangerous and finite, but he
                                    is at home in the world. He can love the shape of human beings, the fine and twisted
                                    shapes of the heart. It is good to have among us such men, such balancing monsters
                                    of love.
